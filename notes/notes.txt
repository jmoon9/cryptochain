Chain Validation:

1) Correct block fields present
2) LastHash value must reference previous block correctly
3) Valid hash
	- Take all fields in block --> recreate hash, compare with hash in block
	- If anything is changed, the block is declared invalid and rejected


Blockchain network -->  different instances of the blockchain work together to determine longest valid chain

Chain Replacement:


Chain Rework strategy:

Arduino MCU controller handles blockchain --> automatically mines block at 10 total data transacitons in transaciton pool
Communications between system nodes and MCU are treated as "transactions"

Transaction data mapping:
	- id --> uuid()
	- outputMap --> 
		- Device data structures replace sender wallet addresses:
			- Balance becomes total # of packages received/sent from MCU
			- Sender/recipient becomes deviceid or MCU id
			-
